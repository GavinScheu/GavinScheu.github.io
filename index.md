# 👋 Hi, I'm Gavin Scheu

I'm a Computer Science and AI enthusiast passionate about motorsport data analytics and reinforcement learning.  
Currently, I'm exploring two major projects that combine my technical skills and racing interests.

---

## 🏁 Project 1: Race Strategy Optimization with XGBoost

Using machine learning (XGBoost), I built a model that predicts lap times during endurance races like Petit Le Mans.

- Predicts clean laps from noisy telemetry data  
- Highlights sector importance and outlier laps  
- Helps strategists and race engineers optimize stints

## 🧠 Project 2: Reinforcement Learning Ball Navigation

This project demonstrates how a Deep Q-Network (DQN) can learn to navigate a ball around a 2D track.

- Built with PyTorch and Pygame  
- Includes reward shaping, collision penalties, and visual rendering  
- Great for game AI, robotics, or autonomous vehicle prototyping
