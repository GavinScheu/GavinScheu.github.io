# 👋 Hi, I'm Gavin Scheu

I'm a Computer Science and AI-focused student working on cutting-edge motorsport analytics and reinforcement learning.  
This site highlights two of my favorite projects:

- 🏎️ **Race Strategy Optimization** with XGBoost
- 🧠 **Reinforcement Learning Ball Navigation**

## 🏁 Race Strategy with XGBoost

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GavinScheu/GavinScheu.github.io/main/assets/xgboost_chart.png" width="100%" alt="XGBoost Lap Strategy">

This project uses **XGBoost machine learning** to predict optimal race strategies in iRacing — including:

- Lap time forecasting
- Tire degradation modeling
- Fuel strategy predictions

## 🧠 Ball Navigation with Reinforcement Learning

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GavinScheu/GavinScheu.github.io/main/assets/ball_navigation.gif" width="100%" alt="RL Ball Navigation">

This project demonstrates a reinforcement learning model that teaches a ball how to navigate a curved track using trial-and-error learning.

- Uses Q-learning and reward shaping
- Visualizes pathfinding convergence
- Trains across thousands of iterations

👉 [Explore the RL project](ai_ball_navigation.md)
