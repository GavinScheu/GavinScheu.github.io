# 🚀 Gavin Scheu — AI Projects, Racing Strategy, and Creative Engineering

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository. I'm a Computer Science major at Auburn University with a deep interest in AI, motorsport analytics, and creative app development. This site documents the experiments, tools, and projects I’ve built to explore the intersection of **data, intelligence, and design**.

## 🔧 Featured Projects

### 🏁 Race Strategy & Predictive Modeling
Using Garage 61 telemetry data, I built a full Google Sheets modeling pipeline to analyze:
- Tire degradation trends using slope regression
- Pit strategy modeling
- Track temp and weather impact
- XGBoost-based stint forecasting (in Python)

### 🧠 Reinforcement Learning — Ball Navigation AI
A game-style simulation using Python where a virtual ball learns to navigate a track through reward-driven movement — showing practical applications of RL in control systems.

### 📱 InnerCurrent — AI-Powered Journaling App (iOS)
A SwiftUI-based mental wellness app with:
- Emotion-tracking AI journal
- Real-time voice-to-text input
- Mood-reactive visuals
- Lottie animations, cloudless storage, and custom Swift features
