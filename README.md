# 🚀 Gavin Scheu — AI Projects, Racing Strategy, and Creative Engineering

Welcome to my portfolio. I'm a **Computer Science major at Auburn University** with a passion for AI, motorsport analytics, and app design. This site showcases the tools, simulations, and systems I’ve built to explore the edge of **data, intelligence, and creativity**.

## 🔧 Featured Projects

### 🏁 Predictive Race Strategy with XGBoost
Leveraging Garage 61 telemetry, I built a Google Sheets pipeline and Python models to:
- Analyze tire degradation via regression
- Model pit strategy and race-time variables
- Use XGBoost to forecast stint performance under varying race conditions

### 🧠 Reinforcement Learning Ball Navigation AI
A Python simulation where a ball learns to navigate a custom track using reinforcement learning. This project explores Q-learning and DQN methods for control systems and autonomous behavior.

### 📱 *InnerCurrent* – AI Wellness App (iOS)
A mental health journaling app built in SwiftUI featuring:
- Real-time voice-to-text journaling
- Emotion-aware AI feedback
- Mood-reactive jellyfish visuals with Lottie animations
- Local data storage for privacy-first usage

## 🎯 Vision

I aim to build technically rigorous, user-friendly tools that push boundaries in:
- **AI for motorsport & performance strategy**
- **Creative, emotion-aware health technologies**
- **Human-centered software interfaces**

This repository is a living archive of experiments and projects — with more to come.
